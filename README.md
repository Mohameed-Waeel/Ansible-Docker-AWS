# Ansible-Docker-AWS
This project automates AWS infrastructure creation with Terraform, installs Docker and Docker-Compose on an EC2 instance using Ansible, and deploys a WordPress and MySQL stack via Docker-Compose. The infrastructure includes a VPC, public subnet, and an EC2 instance (docker_server) for service deployment.
